## Install Dependencies
Make sure you upgrade node and npm to the latest version! i'm using node v10 and npm. With node I had more luck just downloading the installer instead of using package managers. This is super important for react native.
You might run into some issues, you might be able to fix it by installing watchman and metro bundler.
After updating node (I used the installer, not command line)
`npm install npm@latest -g`
If ugrading node and npm doesn't work...
`npm install watchman`
`npm install metro-bundler`
